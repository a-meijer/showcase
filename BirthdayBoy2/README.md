# BIRTHDAY BOY
## Introduction
Hello and welcome to my Birthday Boy project.
I call this project BirthdayBoy2 just to get out of the way of other people who already have projects named "Birthday Boy."
Today is February 28, 2022.
This project is a threefold test of my abilities:
 - I am testing my ability to contribute to my Github repository from this reimaged computer.
 - I am testing my ability to use Draw.io to make a flow diagram to act as a pseudocode for the project.
 - I am testing my ability to record the process of making this project and posting it to YouTube.

## Project Description
Create a program with two functions. 
Firstly, given a person's birth date, and a date representing the current day, calculate their age. 
Secondly, given a person's age & birthday, and a date representing the current day, calculate their birth year.
Notice the difference between birth date and birthday is that birthday excludes the year.

## Corpus Hermetica
I will be taking all my notes here with no initial form of organization, just my notes. This is a fairly small project, so I don't expect the documentation to develop much further. I am planning to make a video with content of me making the code for it and the diagram or whatever. I think I will record the diagram-making separately and 
I sketched up a diagram of how I want the program to be formed.
Now I am going into Diagrams.net (formerly Draw.io) to make a tidier version. I will screenshot the result to include in this project directory.
Testing OBS with with Firefox and VSCode. I will be using OpenShot for editing the videos. I ended up switching to a downloaded version of Diagrams.net instead of using Firefox.
I recorded a video of myself creating the diagram. I should include a copy of the screenshot in the github directory.
I want to write this solution in C++ so that I can easily create an executable. Googling snippets for I/O.
Starting video. . . let's build this live!
...Cowboy coding ensues. I should remember to include the link to the video when I finally post this on GitHub.
I had to pause to download and install gcc.
