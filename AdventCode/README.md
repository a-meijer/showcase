# README Advent of Code
## Project Description
Hello.
I am currently working on Advent of Code 2021, starting on December 6, 2021.
I am using python for Advent of Code 2021 because I think leveraging regex with help me input data from files easily
Based on what I discovered from Advent of Code 2020, problems require file i/o.
I am hoping that regex will save a lot of time with this project.
