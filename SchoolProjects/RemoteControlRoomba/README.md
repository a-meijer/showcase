# Remote Control Roomba Project (Part 3)
This directory contains a PDF report of my classwork with teammate Kenzie Wong.
In the project, Kenzie and I override the software on a roomba by plugging in an encoded Arduino. We also add a bluetooth chip to the Arduino and connect it to a remote control on a separate Arduino.

In the end, Kenzie and I battled our roomba against other teams by equipping it with a laser and light-sensor and playing laser tag.
