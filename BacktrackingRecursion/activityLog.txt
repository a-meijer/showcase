INDEV006: Add Instructions - Open
    2020-11-15  :   Entry Created
    2020-11-15  :   Now that there are header files, remember to create compilation instructions in the Readme!

INDEV005: Rewrite Readme - Closed
    2020-11-15  :   Entry Created
    2020-11-15  :   Rewrite the README according to the new scope of the project, to write 2 nxnQueens solutions.

INDEV004: Pivot Project - Open
    2020-11-15  :   Entry Created
    2020-11-15  :   Maintain the new vision for the project is to create two files that solve nxnQueens, one with structs and one with classes. Glhf; let's make this quick.
    2020-11-15  :   I have experienced a VS Code warning while writing structs in C, "incomplete type is not allowed."
                    I believe I must create a header file for this!

INDEV003: include Prototype1 in Readme - Closed
    2020-11-05  :   Entry Created
    2020-11-05  :   Write a paragraph summary of the first prototype, which will be recursive.
    Later prototypes will require one recursive algorithm and one iterative algorithm to compare space and time efficiency.
    This first prototype will only include the recursive example of backtracking.

INDEV002: Define Terms - Closed
    2020-11-05  :   Entry Created
    2020-11-05  :   The readme should include a section to explain each of the two terms, recursion and backtracking.
    Consider the type of problem that backtracking is made to solve and how that type of problem can be represented simply.
    If it turns out that Backtracking is codeword for something like NP-Hard, this project will become a study of various algorithms for that class of problems, and I will pivot the project description.
    2020-11-06  :   It turns out that Backtracking is used to solve CSP, so I have updated the readme accordingly.
    Now I will need to include definitions for Iteration, Backtracking, Recursion, and CSP.

INDEV001: Update Project Description - Closed
    2020-11-05  :   Entry Created
    2020-11-05  :   The project description at the top of the readme should include mention of the possibility that no proof can be found.
