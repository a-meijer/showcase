INDEV003: include Prototype1 in Readme
    2020-11-05  :   Opened
    2020-11-05  :   Write a paragraph summary of the first prototype, which will be recursive.
    Later prototypes will require one recursive algorithm and one iterative algorithm to compare space and time efficiency.
    This first prototype will only include the recursive example of backtracking.

INDEV002: Define Terms
    2020-11-05  :   Opened
    2020-11-05  :   The readme should include a section to explain each of the two terms, recursion and backtracking.
    Consider the type of problem that backtracking is made to solve and how that type of problem can be represented simply.
    If it turns out that Backtracking is codeword for something like NP-Hard, this project will become a study of various algorithms for that class of problems, and I will pivot the project description.

INDEV001: Update Project Description
    2020-11-05  :   Opened
    2020-11-05  :   The project description at the top of the readme should include mention of the possibility that no proof can be found.
