# Backtracking Recursion Readme
## Project Description
Backtracking is an algorithm that uses recursion and can efficiently solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP). I hypothesise that iterative algorithms cannot solve CSP as efficiently as recursive backtracking algorithms. The purpose of this project is to build from scratch two algorithms to solve CSP: a recursive backtracking algorithm and an iterative algorithm, and to prove or disprove if possible the above hypothesis.

## Recursion
An algorithm is recursive if 

## Backtracking


## Iteration


## CSP
CSP include three categories of data: variables, domains, and constrains.
