# Backtracking Recursion Readme
## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create two backtracking algorithms to solve the nxn queens problem. 
One algorithm will be written in C with structs, and the other algorithm will be written in C++ with classes.

## nxn Queens, Backtracking Algorithms, and CSP
Backtracking algorithms are used to solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), and nxn Queens is a CSP. For a problem to be CSP, it can be written as the problem of assigning variables to domains according to a set of constrains. In nxn Queeens, the problem is to put n queens on an nxn chess board such that no queens are attacking each other according to the rules of chess, and find all solutions. With respect to CSP, the variables are the queens, the domains are the squares on the board, and the constraint is that no queen can be placed in attacking range of any other. To simplify the interface for this problem, the value n will be hardcoded into the source files, and the output to the console will be the total number of solutions followed by an arbitrary solution.
