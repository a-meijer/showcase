# Backtracking Recursion Readme
This project is a repository for investigation into backtracking and recursion using the C language. Backtracking is an algorithm that uses recursion to efficiently solve a problem, but what is backtracking exactly, and how can it be done without recursion? Prove that recursion is either necessary or unncessary in the context of backtracking.
