# READ ME

This project is based on Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorith (DSP) which is well known.
I didn't use an efficient implementation of DSP that relies on min-heaps.
For an optimized python implementation of DSP, search elsewhere.
I made this implementation from memory because DSP is one of my favourite algorithms from school.

This readme is incomplete and the project isn't currently running.
Come back later for more details.
