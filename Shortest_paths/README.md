# READ ME

This project is based on Dijkstra's Shortest Path algorith (DSP) which is well known. I didn't use an efficient implementation of DSP that relies on min-heaps. For an optimized python implementation of DSP, search elsewhere.
I made this implementation from memory as a warm-up challenge.
This readme is incomplete and the project isn't currently running.
Check back later for updates.
