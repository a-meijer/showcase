This match data is publicly available; you can copy the match results into a spreadsheet, clean it down to two columns, and export the results to a CSV file.
Therefore, you can run this algorithm on matches from any other tournament on the badminton canada page.

Add note to readme about tuning the algorithm, choosing the K-value, initial rankings, and other implementation factors.

Add note to readme about the necessity of switching to a double elimination bracket because evidentially players don't care about consolation and single elimination doesn't place the top 4 or top 8; double elimination with consolation allows for consolation matches to be ranking/placement matches.
