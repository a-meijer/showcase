# Chess Game Validator Readme
Since this is a public repository, it is important that I mention this project is part of a school project at The University of Victoria in a multithreaded programming course.

The idea of the project is to input a recorded chess game as a list of moves and output True or False whether the input is a valid chess game or not.

Implementing threads to solve the chess game validation problem was a challenge. An unexpected challenge I faced during this project was to verify the correctness of my solution. Testing turned out to be quite troublesome, in part due to the nodeterministic nature of multithreaded programs.

Unfortunately, this project is still unfinished and not working. With respect to multithreading, I plan to start a different project wherein I tackle problems from The Little Book of Semaphores using pthreads. If my project with The Little Book of Semaphores is a success, I will return to this project again.
