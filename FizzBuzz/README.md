# FizzBuzz Readme
This project directory contains examples of FizzBuzz written in various programming languages. There are many ways to solve FizzBuzz and it is a simple problem. I have included the correct results in a file, "solution.txt."
I have also included a program for comparing file contents, so that I can quickly check when I have the right output. The source is in "checkSolution.c"

## Purpose
To explore syntax and semantics in various prevalent programming languages and scripting languages. The purpose of this project is not to prove optimality of any solution or to optimize any of the solutions.
The following languages are on my hit-list: Haskell, Ruby, Python, Java, Javascript, C, C++, and C#.

## FizzBuzz Problem Definition 
To solve FizzBuzz, write a program that prints out the numbers 1 to 100, with one number per line.   
Exceptions:   
If any number is divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead.  
If any number is divisible by 5, print "Buzz" instead.  
If any number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz."  
To see what a correct solution looks like, refer to the file, "solution.txt"

## Index
What follows is a list of all the FizzBuzz source files in this directory. The list item has compilation notes or notes about development that are not commented into the files themselves.

# FizzBuzz.java
Compile with "javac FizzBuzz.java"
Run with "java FizzBuzz"
FizzBuzz.java outputs to the console.
Note to self, if I run this file using the command-line, then I can't have a line, "package FizzBuzz." If I compile and run using the IDE, then I need to include "package FizzBuzz."
VSCode produces an annoying red text whenever I remove the package.
