# README Website Portfolio Project
## Project Description
This website project is being made using the React JS & Bootstrap video guide available on youtube: https://youtu.be/vD72tRK8mC4
The website is not yet being hosted online and is currently unavailable; the website is in early development stages.
After completing the youtube tutorial, I will continue to use and adapt the website as a progress tracker for future programming projects.
