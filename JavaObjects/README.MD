# Java Objects Project Readme
We all know OOP is totally great, but how often do you find yourself unsure of what design-patterns to use? This project aims to provide simple examples for conventional design-patterns in Java. In this project, I will write Java code from scratch for conventional design-patterns such as Decorators and Factories, and I will write a framework to test my solutions. I'll also make an development log to record my testing progress.

## Testing Framework
The main premise of the testing framework is to write my tests using file input rather than command line. Automated testing opens the door for more advanced testing. To build on the testing framework, I add functionality to measure my solutions.

## Development Log
developmentLog.txt
The development log is my journal for this project where I go to plan my next moves and therefore avoid cowboy coding practices.
