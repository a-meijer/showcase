# Advent Code Advent Calendar 2020
## Project Description
Solve the codes! - Work in Progress.
I will be writing my solution in C++, taking input from text files as needed.

## Puzzles
### Day 1 : Report Repair
I am developing a function for file input based on the following two sources:
https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/
https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/stoi/
I'm keeping it all in main to avoid having to use pointers for my integer array passing to a function. . .
.. Okay, I got the right answer. I just printed out the two numbers and did the multiplication on a separate calculator.
Part Two is simple, I just added a third nested for loop.
Complete.

## Conclusion
After reviewing the instructions for the second puzzle, I have decided not to continue because I am not interested in using C++ for parsing data files, and rather than switch to Python and continue with Advent of Code 2020, I have other projects where my time is better spent.
In total, I completed Advent of Code 2020 with 2 stars.
