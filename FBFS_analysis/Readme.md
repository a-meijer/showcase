# FoodBank and FreeStore Readme
This directory contains a pdf report which is the final submission from a group project I completed during my undergraduate Computer Science degree at the University of Victora.

The University of Victoria has a FoodBank and FreeStore (FBFS) where students who need that support can pick up food and clothing. FBFS has a database system for keeping track of the inventory and transactions.

Our team performed a System Analysis on FBFS to discover how switching from a paper-based database to a digital database solved business problems.
