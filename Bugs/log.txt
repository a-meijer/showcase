LOG_ENTRY_002   -   Sample One  - 2021-10-10
    The first sample comes from my nxnQueens project which is in this same repository at the time of writing.
    I am compiling and running the source files to make sure they are working in this new directory.
    All of the details are in Sample1.md.
    Here's what it looks like on my terminal in VS Code:
        PS C:\PROG\showcase> cd Bugs/Sample1/src
        PS C:\PROG\showcase\Bugs\Sample1\src> g++ testFile1.cpp -Wall -o ../bin/file1
        PS C:\PROG\showcase\Bugs\Sample1\src> ../bin/file1
        PS C:\PROG\showcase\Bugs\Sample1\src> g++ testFile2.cpp -Wall -o ../bin/file2
        PS C:\PROG\showcase\Bugs\Sample1\src> ../bin/file2
        test successful.
        test successful.
        test successful.
        test successful.
        boards identical.
        PS C:\PROG\showcase\Bugs\Sample1\src>

LOG_ENTRY_001   -   New Project - 2021-10-10
    Hello, this is the first log entry for the Bugs project.
    The way this works is, I create entries in this log to record what I'm doing in the Bugs project.
    Since this project is created just to archive bugs, I have a very simple structure to the log, 
    I'll just make an entry whenever I add a bug sample or solve one.
