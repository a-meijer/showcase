# Bugs Readme
## Project Description
The purpose of the Bugs project is to archive the bugs I encounter in other projects.
Each bug is placed into it's own sample subfoler, and includes a markdown file with instructions and details of the bug.
For example, Sample1 contains a file named Sample1.md.
In general, each sample can be interpreted as a challenge to find and explain the cause of the bug.
If any bugs are solved, the solution will be detailed in the markdown file for that bug.
